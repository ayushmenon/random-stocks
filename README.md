Full-stack web app built using MongoDB, Express, React, NodeJS, and Socket.io.
The prompt was to essentially build a fake API for stocks that updates every second randomly within 5% of the current price and display them. 

The front-end of the app displays the stock dashboard and real-time graph of one stock. 
The back-end is a REST API with endpoints that enable all CRUD operations.
The use of web sockets enables the real-time updates.

Some next steps could include adding a form to add stocks, adding front-end onclick functionality to change which stock the graph depicts,
and the addition of a portfolio.
